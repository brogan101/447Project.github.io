	<h2 id="step1">Step 1: Engine Removal</h2>
	<p>The first step in rebuilding an LS engine is to remove it from the vehicle. Refer to the vehicle's service manual for instructions on how to properly remove the engine.</p>

	
	<h2 id="step2">Step 2: Engine Disassembly</h2>
	<p>After the engine has been removed from the vehicle, it's time to disassemble it. Refer to the vehicle's service manual for instructions on how to properly disassemble the engine.</p>

	
	<h2 id="step3">Step 3: Cleaning and Inspection</h2>
	<p>Once the engine has been disassembled, it's important to thoroughly clean and inspect all parts. This includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Cleaning all parts with a degreaser</li>
		<li>Inspecting all parts for wear and damage</li>
		<li>Measuring all parts to ensure they are within specification</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Refer to the vehicle's service manual for any additional cleaning and inspection procedures.</p>


	<h2 id="step4">Step 4: Parts Replacement</h2>
	<p>After the engine has been cleaned and inspected, it's time to replace any worn or damaged parts. Below are the part numbers for common replacement parts:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Pistons: ABC123</li>
		<li>Piston rings: DEF456</li>
		<li>Connecting rods: GHI789</li>
		<li>Camshaft bearings: JKL012</li>
		<li>Cylinder head gaskets: MNO345</li>
		<li>Main bearings: PQR678</li>
		<li>Timing set: STU901</li>
		<li>Oil pump: VWX234</li>
		<li>Water pump: YZA567</li>
		<li>Valve springs: BCD890</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Be sure to order any additional parts specific to your engine.</p>

	
	<h2 id="step5">Step 5: Reassembly</h2>
	<p>With all new parts on hand, it's time to begin reassembling the engine. Refer to the vehicle's service manual for instructions on how to properly reassemble the engine.</p>

	
    <h2 id="step6">Step 6: Torque Specs and Angle</h2>
	<p>Before tightening any bolts, it's important to refer to the vehicle's service manual for the proper torque specifications and angle for each bolt. Below are the torque specs and angle for common bolts:</p>

	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Bolt</th>
				<th>Torque Spec (ft-lbs)</th>
				<th>Angle</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Main bearing cap bolts</td>
				<td>70</td>
				<td>70 degrees</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Connecting rod bolts</td>
				<td>45</td>
				<td>90 degrees</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Cylinder head bolts</td>
				<td>22</td>
				<td>60 degrees</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Intake manifold bolts</td>
				<td>18</td>
				<td>30 degrees</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Exhaust manifold bolts</td>
				<td>23</td>
				<td>30 degrees</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Oil pan bolts</td>
				<td>18</td>
				<td>30 degrees</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Water pump bolts</td>
				<td>18</td>
				<td>30 degrees</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Timing cover bolts</td>
				<td>18</td>
				<td>30 degrees</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
